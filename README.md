# AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.

## Deploying to AWS

For detailed instructions on deploying your application, refer to the [deployment section](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/#deploy-a-fullstack-app-to-aws) of our documentation.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## üîí Security Considerations

- All AWS credentials should be managed through AWS Secrets Manager
- Environment variables should never be committed to the repository
- Follow AWS security best practices for IAM roles and permissions
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API flows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
